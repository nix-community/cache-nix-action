author: "GitHub"
inputs:
  primary-key:
    description: |
      - When a non-empty string, the action uses this key for saving a cache.
      - Otherwise, the action fails.
    required: true

  nix:
    description: |
      - Can have an effect only when the action runs on a `Linux` or a `macOS` runner.
      - When `true`, the action can do Nix-specific things.
      - Otherwise, the action doesn't do them.
    default: "true"

  save:
    description: |
      - When `true`, the action can save a cache with the `primary-key`.
      - Otherwise, the action can't save a cache.
    default: "true"

  paths:
    description: |
      - When `nix: true`, the action uses `["/nix", "~/.cache/nix", "~root/.cache/nix"]` as default paths, as suggested [here](https://github.com/divnix/nix-cache-action/blob/b14ec98ae694c754f57f8619ea21b6ab44ccf6e7/action.yml#L7).
      - Otherwise, the action uses an empty list as default paths.
      - When a newline-separated non-empty list of non-empty path patterns (see [`@actions/glob`](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/glob) for supported patterns), the action appends it to default paths and uses the resulting list for saving caches.
      - Otherwise, the action uses default paths for saving caches.
    default: ""
  paths-macos:
    description: |
      - Overrides `paths`.
      - Can have an effect only when the action runs on a `macOS` runner.
    default: ""
  paths-linux:
    description: |
      - Overrides `paths`.
      - Can have an effect only when the action runs on a `Linux` runner.
    default: ""

  backend:
    description: |
      Choose an implementation of the `cache` package.
      - When `actions`, use the [actions version](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/cache) from [here](https://github.com/nix-community/cache-nix-action/tree/actions-toolkit/packages/cache).
      - When `buildjet`, use the [BuildJet version](https://github.com/BuildJet/toolkit/tree/main/packages/cache-buildjet) from [here](https://github.com/nix-community/cache-nix-action/tree/buildjet-toolkit/packages/cache).
    default: "actions"
    required: false

  gc-max-store-size:
    description: |
      - Can have an effect only when `nix: true`, `save: true`.
      - The input has no effect if "primary-key" hit occurs when starting to save the new cache.
      - When a number, the action collects garbage (via `nix store gc --max ...`) until the Nix store size (in bytes) is at most this number just before the action tries to save a new cache.
      - Otherwise, this input has no effect.
    default: ""
  gc-max-store-size-macos:
    description: |
      - Overrides `gc-max-store-size`.
      - Can have an effect only when the action runs on a `macOS` runner.
    default: ""
  gc-max-store-size-linux:
    description: |
      - Overrides `gc-max-store-size`.
      - Can have an effect only when the action runs on a `Linux` runner.
    default: ""

  purge:
    description: |
      - When `true`, the action purges (possibly zero) caches.
      - The action purges only caches scoped to the current [GITHUB_REF](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#default-environment-variables).
      - Otherwise, this input has no effect.
    default: "false"
  purge-primary-key:
    description: |
      - Can have an effect only when `purge: true`.
      - When `always`, the action always purges the cache with the `primary-key`.
      - When `never`, the action never purges the cache with the `primary-key`.
      - Otherwise, this input has no effect.
    default: ""
  purge-prefixes:
    description: |
      - Can have an effect only when `purge: true`.
      - When a newline-separated non-empty list of non-empty cache key prefixes, the action selects for purging all caches whose keys match some of these prefixes.
      - Otherwise, this input has no effect.
    default: ""
  purge-last-accessed:
    description: |
      - Can have an effect only when `purge: true`.
      - When a non-negative number, the action purges selected caches that were last accessed more than this number of seconds ago relative to the start of the Save step.
      - Otherwise, this input has no effect.
    default: ""
  purge-created:
    description: |
      - Can have an effect only when `purge: true`.
      - When a non-negative number, the action purges selected caches that were created more than this number of seconds ago relative to the start of the Save step.
      - Otherwise, this input has no effect.
    default: ""

  upload-chunk-size:
    # The original default value may be provided here (https://github.com/actions/cache/issues/1292)
    # 32MB
    description: |
      - When a non-negative number, the action uses it as the chunk size (in bytes) to split up large files during upload.
      - Otherwise, the action uses the default value `33554432` (32MB).
    default: ""

  token:
    description: |
      - The action uses it to communicate with GitHub API.
      - If you use a personal access token, it must have the `repo` scope ([link](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/cache?apiVersion=2022-11-28#delete-github-actions-caches-for-a-repository-using-a-cache-key)).
