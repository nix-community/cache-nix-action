      - When a newline-separated non-empty list of non-empty path patterns (see [`@actions/glob`](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/glob) for supported patterns), the action appends it to `["/nix", "~/.cache/nix", "~root/.cache/nix"]` and uses the resulting list for saving caches.
      - Otherwise, the action uses `["/nix", "~/.cache/nix", "~root/.cache/nix"]` for saving caches.

  gc-max-store-size:
    description: |
      - When a number, the action collects garbage until Nix store size (in bytes) is at most this number just before trying to save a new cache.
      - Otherwise, this input has no effect.

  purge:
    description: |
      - When `true`, the action purges (possibly zero) old caches.

  purge-overwrite:
    description: |
      - Can have an effect only when `purge` has effect.
      - When `always`, the action always purges old cache(s) with the `primary-key` and saves a new cache with the `primary-key`.
      - When `never`, the action never purges old cache(s) with the `primary-key` and saves a new cache when there's a miss on the `primary-key`.
      - Otherwise, the action purges old caches using purging criteria and saves a new cache when there's a miss on the `primary-key`.
    default: ""
  purge-prefixes:
    description: |
      - Can have an effect only when `purge` has effect.
      - When a newline-separated non-empty list of non-empty cache key prefixes, the action collects for purging all cache keys that match these prefixes.

  purge-last-accessed:
    description: |
      - Can have an effect only when `purge-prefixes` has effect.
      - When a number, the action purges caches last accessed more than this number of seconds ago relative to the start of the Save phase.
